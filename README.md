# rl-course
This is the code repository for programming exercises of the Reinforcement Learning lecture at the University of Stuttgart.
https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/reinforcement-learning-ss-20

## Requirements
All exercises will be done with python3.

The first exercise uses numpy and matplotlib:
```bash
python3 -m pip install numpy matplotlib --user
```

Later exercises will use openai gym (https://gym.openai.com/):
```bash
python3 -m pip install gym --user
```

And tensorflow2 for Deep Reinforcement Learning (https://www.tensorflow.org/):
```bash
python3 -m pip install tensorflow --user
```

## Exercises

## Exercise 01 - k-arms Bandit

## Exercise 02 - Brute force value function

## Exercise 03 - Dynamic Programming


## Exercise 99 - Policy Search

Reinforcement Learning (Policy search), Deep Learning (CNN and Transfer Learning), Image identification (YOLO) and Stochastic Optimization (Genetic algorithm) techniques were used to optimize the policy of the OpenGymAI Lunar-Lander-V2 Environment 

Development made with help of Tensorflow and DEAP packages.
